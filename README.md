## 👁️ What is FocAi?

FocAi is a **fully conversational, multi-turn image recognition chatbot** that combines Claude claude-sonnet-4-6's vision capabilities with a sleek chat interface. Unlike static image analyzers, FocAi **remembers the image across the entire conversation** — upload once, then ask unlimited follow-up questions.

Whether you're identifying a plant, debugging an error screen, extracting text from a photo, or turning ingredient photos into recipes — FocAi adapts its intelligence to match your intent.

**Key design decisions:**
- **Full conversation history** sent on every API call → true multi-turn context
- **Base64 image persisted** in React state → no re-upload needed between messages
- **System prompt engineering** → FocAi's tone, persona, and analysis rules injected at system level

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 18 (JSX) | UI, state management, chat interface |
| **Styling** | Vanilla CSS + Google Fonts | Zero dependency, full control |
| **AI Model** | Claude claude-sonnet-4-6 (Anthropic) | Vision + language understanding |
| **API** | Anthropic Messages API `/v1/messages` | Multi-modal message handling |
| **Image Processing** | FileReader API (Base64) | Client-side image encoding |
| **Deployment** | Claude.ai Artifacts | Zero-setup instant live demo |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1 — Run Instantly (Recommended)

FocAi is built as a **self-contained React JSX file**. To run it instantly:
1. Open [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Paste the contents of `FocAi.jsx` into the chat
3. Claude renders it live — no setup, no build, no config

### Option 2 — Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VishalRS2466-maker/FocAi.git
cd FocAi

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Add your Anthropic API key to .env
echo "VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

> ⚠️ **Security note:** For production deployments, always route Anthropic API calls through a backend server. Never expose API keys in client-side bundles.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
FocAi/
├── FocAi.jsx        # Complete self-contained chatbot component
├── README.md        # You are here
└── LICENSE          # MIT License
```

`FocAi.jsx` is intentionally **single-file** — all logic, styles, and API calls in one place for maximum portability and easy Artifact deployment.

---

## 🔬 How Vision API Works

FocAi sends images as **base64-encoded image blocks** alongside text prompts:

```javascript
// Single API call — image + text + full conversation history
{
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: [
        {
          type: "image",
          source: {
            type: "base64",
            media_type: "image/jpeg",
            data: "<base64_string>"
          }
        },
        { type: "text", text: "What can I cook with these ingredients?" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For multi-turn conversations, the full message history (including prior image blocks) is sent on each request — giving FocAi persistent visual memory throughout the session.
